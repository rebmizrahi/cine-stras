A fake movie theatre website that lists movies and descriptions. It allows admins to log in and update movie names and descriptions, add other admins, and see all admin accounts created. There is also a translation feature that trabslates all html but not content from the database, i.e. headers and buttons but not the movie titles and descriptions.

Project to practice PHP, MySQL, Javascript, AJAX, CSS.<br>

(No commits because I worked on this project through gitlab and just uploaded it once completed)
